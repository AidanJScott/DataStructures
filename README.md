This project was meant to recreate what I learned in my Data Structures course. 

I have created my own input files, and I have attached the code that I used to make them. 
If you run the code, it will overwrite the current files, and it will probably take around ten minutes. 
I would recommend using the text files I provided if you would just like to test the main program. 

Download all of the files into a folder, and run the Data_Structures_Main file to see the project. 
The program runs through the console where you interact with all of the menus. 

Each data structure has an associated file that if run, runs a mini-demo that tests all of the functions of each data structure.
